# PaveSTITCH-SynKpacK
Stitches pavement images from the sensor fusion of accelerometers, RGB-D camera, GPS and LED. Also, synchronizes the data from these sensors. For stitching module, refer to [AutoPanoStitch](https://github.com/preethamam/AutoPanoStitch).

# Sensors required
Single or multiple Kinects <br />
Single or multiple accelerometers <br />
GPS <br />
LED <br />

# Requirements
MATLAB <br />
MATLAB - Image Processing Toolbox <br />
MATLAB - Signal Processing Toolbox <br />

# Note
Some of the implementation is pending due to the lack of funding 2014.
